# Study cases for multi-scale analyses of tree structure (by Evelyne Costes)

## Examples of up-scaling

Change geometric parameter at phytomer scale, for example, i.e. phytomere basal diameter and or length that modifies the biomechanical model.
Then extract the main direction and curvature of the branches (calculate as the ratio between branch length and cord).
Extract the light interception by STAR calculation at tree scale, based on the leaves positions

## Example of down scaling

Change the transition probabilities at growth unit scale, that generate the type of successive GU in successive years.
Then extract the distribution of phytomer and flower numbers per year
Or extract the distances in phytomer number, between fruits and the closest leaves, depending on shoot types (types classified by length of the GU).

## Example of output using several scales

Calculate the leaf area and the number of fruit per shoot, then per branch and per tree to estimate a crop load at different scales in the tree (see paper Belhassine et al. 2019)
